# Title: Processing and Utilization of GHCN-Daily Data for the Yangtze River Domain

---

## Slide 1 — Overview

**Topic:**  
Preparation and analysis of the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily (GHCN-Daily) dataset for the Yangtze River Basin and its extended surroundings.

**Purpose:**  
To construct a consistent observation-based reference for:
* evaluating WRF-Hydro downscaled outputs, and  
* performing bias correction after downscaling and data assimilation.

The GHCNd dataset is **not** used as direct model forcing, but as an independent benchmark for **post-simulation validation and bias adjustment**.

## Slide 2 — Data Source

**GHCN-Daily (Version 3)**  
NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)  

**Citation:**  
Menne, M. J., Durre, I., Korzeniewski, B., McNeill, S., Thomas, K., Yin, X., Anthony, S., Ray, R., Vose, R. S., Gleason, B. E., & Houston, T. G. (2012):  
*Global Historical Climatology Network – Daily (GHCN-Daily), Version 3.*  
NOAA National Climatic Data Center. doi: 10.7289/V5D21VHZ.  
Publications citing this dataset should also cite: *J. Atmos. Oceanic Technol.*, 29, 897–910.  

**Variables:**  
TMAX, TMIN, PRCP, SNOW, SNWD, AWND, WSFG, WDFG, and weather-type flags (WTxx).

**Time coverage:** 1901–2025 (station dependent)

**Note on daily definition:**  
Each country uses its own climatological day.  
China reports **20:00 – 20:00 Beijing Time** for daily accumulation,  
and daily mean temperature = (02 + 08 + 14 + 20 h observations)/4.  
Hence, cross-country comparisons must consider differing day boundaries.

## Slide 3 — Geographic Extents

Two spatial domains were defined for analysis:

**Outer Nest (BIG_REGION_BBOX)**  
```
(85.5°E – 130.0°E, 18.0°N – 40.0°N)
```
Covers East and Southeast Asia — used for wide-area validation of WRF-Hydro downscaling performance.

**Inner Nest (YANGTZE_BBOX)**  
```
(89.5°E – 123.0°E, 24.0°N – 36.5°N)
```
Focused on the Yangtze River Basin, used for hydrologic process analysis and flood reconstruction.

## Slide 4 — Processing Steps

1. **Station Filtering**  
   Parsed `ghcnd-inventory.txt`, extracted stations within defined BBOX ranges.  
   Two station sets created: *big_window* (East Asia + Southeast Asia) and *china_only* (mainland + HK/Macau/Taiwan).

2. **Temporal Analysis**  
   Counted number of stations with data available per year (1901–2025).  
   Produced yearly count tables and stacked bar charts (China vs. outside-China).

3. **Spatial Visualization**  
   Generated annual distribution maps and comparative maps for 1931, 1935, 1954, 1998 — key flood years.

4. **Hydrographic Overlay**  
   Added Yangtze main stem, tributaries, and basin outline using HydroRIVERS + HydroBASINS.

## Slide 5 — Supporting Geographic Data

**HydroRIVERS & HydroBASINS**  
Lehner, B., & Grill, G. (2013):  
*Global river hydrography and network routing: baseline data and new approaches to study the world’s large river systems.*  
*Hydrological Processes,* 27(15): 2171–2186.  
Data available at [www.hydrosheds.org](https://www.hydrosheds.org).

Used for delineating the Yangtze River system and classifying main vs. tributary channels.

**Natural Earth base layers**  
50 m resolution:
* `ne_50m_land`
* `ne_50m_admin_0_countries`

## Slide 6 — Outputs

* `yearly_counts_big_window.txt`  
* `yearly_counts_big_window_china_only.txt`  
* Annual maps (`stations_<year>.png`)  
* Multi-year comparison map (1931–1998)  
* Stacked bar chart of domestic vs. foreign stations

All results stored under:

## Slide 7 — Application

The processed GHCN-Daily station data are used to:

* Evaluate WRF-Hydro downscaled temperature and precipitation fields.  
* Quantify temporal consistency and spatial representativeness of station observations.  
* Apply bias-correction schemes to downscaled and assimilated outputs, using observation-based reference statistics.

> GHCNd acts as an **independent reference layer**, not as model forcing.  
> It supports the reconstruction and validation of extreme flood years (e.g., 1931, 1954, 1998) under physically consistent frameworks.

## Slide 8 — Summary

* GHCN-Daily data (1901–2025) were spatially and temporally organized for the Yangtze Basin.  
* Station availability and spatial distribution were mapped annually.  
* HydroRIVERS and HydroBASINS provided hydrological context; Natural Earth supplied land and boundary layers.  
* The resulting dataset forms the foundation for **WRF-Hydro validation, bias correction, and assimilation experiments** within the defined nested domains.

*Made with Natural Earth. Data include HydroRIVERS and HydroBASINS (Lehner & Grill 2013).*
